📘 Compiler Design Project — First & Follow Set Generator
This project implements a basic First and Follow Set Generator for context-free grammars, written in Python. It is part of a compiler design coursework and demonstrates how to analyze a grammar to compute:

FIRST sets – to identify possible starting terminals

FOLLOW sets – to identify valid terminals that can follow a non-terminal

📝 Features:
Reads grammar rules from grammar.txt

Supports epsilon (ɛ) productions

Computes First and Follow sets for all non-terminals

Outputs the sets in a readable format

📂 Files Included:
grammar.txt – contains the grammar definitions

compiler.ipynb – Jupyter notebook for computing the First and Follow sets

prac.ipynb – (Optional) testing or practice notebook
